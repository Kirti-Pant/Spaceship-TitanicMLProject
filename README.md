# Spaceship-TitanicMLProject 

I have participated in the kaggle's ongoing competition Spaceship Titanic-Predict which passengers are transported to an alternate dimension. It was totally based on binary classification and accuracy of a model. I've tested 4 Machine Learning algorithm or model like Logistic Regression, RainForest Classifier, Gradient Boosting and SVC for the training. The test file is loaded and tested on the RainForest Classifier(as per competition demand) and guess what, the model predicted right as trained.
The model consists of no underfitting and overfitting. Before training, data -preprocessing and data standardisation steps were strictly followed.
